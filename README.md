######################################################################################

1. fastqc.sh

	-makes the fastqc quality control reports for the fastq files

2. cutadapt.sh and cutadapt_single.sh

	-Adapter trimming and read filtering. cutadapt is for paired end data and cutadapt_single for single end and ion torrent data

3. hisat2_launch.sh and launch_hisat2_single.sh

	-Hisat2 alignment. hisat2_launch for paired end data and launch_hisat2_single for single end data

4. uniq_sort.sh

	- Creates a BAM file with the unique reads and sorts the unique reads. 

5. featurecounts.R

	-Transcript quantification

6. Contents in expression_matrices_and_DEG_result -folder
	
	-Microarray
		-Contains the probe annotation codes for the microarray datasets. Annotations are for ensembl gene id:s and gene Symbols. 
		The R programming required substantial manual effort, largely due to the inherent characteristics of the public data. As a precautionary 
		measure to ensure the accuracy of each step in the analytical process, the analysis included significant redundancy.

	-RNA-seq
		-Contains the low counts filtering for the counts matrix and annotations for gene symbols. Contains also the gene expression matrix normalization and
		differential gene expression analysis with deseq2. The R programming required substantial manual effort, largely due to the inherent characteristics 
		of the public data. As a precautionary  measure to ensure the accuracy of each step in the analytical process, the analysis included significant redundancy.

7. Contents of combined_matrices -folder
	-Contains the code for combining the expression matrices for ipf and healthy samples for each cell type and tissue and RNA-seq and Microarray.

8. multi_studies_adjust.R
	-Pamr batch adjustment code for the combined matrices

9. build_networks.R
	- Network inference code for the batch adjusted combined matrices
